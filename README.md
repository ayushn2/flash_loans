# Flash Loan

A smart contract implementation of a **Flash Loan Protocol**, allowing users to borrow funds from a liquidity pool, use them for arbitrage or other operations, and repay the loan all in the same transaction. This project includes a token contract, a flash loan pool, and a flash loan receiver contract.

## Overview

Flash loans are uncollateralized loans that allow users to borrow tokens from a pool and repay them within the same transaction. This implementation includes:
- A **Token Contract** (`Token.sol`) for creating an ERC-20-like token.
- A **Flash Loan Contract** (`FlashLoan.sol`) for handling the flash loan process.
- A **Flash Loan Receiver Contract** (`FlashLoanReceiver.sol`) for utilizing the borrowed funds and ensuring repayment.

## Features

- **Flash Loan Functionality**: Borrow funds temporarily within a single transaction.
- **Custom Token**: Includes a native ERC-20 token for testing and usage.
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Secured using OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`.
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive test cases to validate contract behavior.

## Contracts

### 1. `Token.sol`
An ERC-20-like implementation with minting functionality for testing. This token is used in the flash loan pool.

### 2. `FlashLoan.sol`
Manages the liquidity pool and provides the following functions:
- `depositTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Deposit tokens into the pool.
- `flashLoan(uint256 _borrowAmount)`: Executes the flash loan.

### 3. `FlashLoanReceiver.sol`
Implements the `IReceiver` interface for receiving and utilizing the flash loan:
- `executeFlashLoan(uint256 _amount)`: Triggers a flash loan and processes the funds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Hardhat (Ethereum development environment)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd flash-loan

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Compile the contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile

4. Deploy the contracts (customize the deployment script as needed):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>

---

### Testing

1. Run the test suite using Hardhat:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test test/FlashLoan.js

2. Key Test Cases:
- Ensure token balance is transferred to the flash loan pool during deployment.
- Validate successful borrowing and repayment in a single transaction.
- Test event emissions and reentrancy protection.
